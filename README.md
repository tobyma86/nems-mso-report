# Navigating the Numbers: Insights into Insurance Claim Management

## Overview

This project delineates the classification of insurance claim entries for the Managed Service Organization (MSO) at North East Medical Services (NEMS) during my volunteering in Fall 2025. Central to this analysis is a payment summary table derived from NEMS's medical management database, which encompasses individual insurance claim summaries from various providers to HPSM from July 2024 to March 2025. Each entry incorporates key data fields, and the raw dataset has been omitted to ensure HIPAA compliance.
